## 🌈 Vision

> *"The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."* — Tim Berners-Lee

In a world where digital experiences shape our daily lives, **WEB for ALL** stands as a beacon of digital inclusion. We're not just building another browser extension; we're pioneering a movement to transform how people with diverse abilities experience the web.

### Our Promise

Every feature we build, every line of code we write serves one purpose: **to ensure no one is left behind in the digital revolution**. Whether you're navigating with a screen reader, controlling your device with voice commands, or needing simplified content—we've got you covered.
